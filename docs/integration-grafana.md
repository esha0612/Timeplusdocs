# Integration with Grafana

For self-hosted Timeplus Enterprise or Timeplus Proton, you can also try [the Grafana plugin for Timeplus](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/timeplus-proton-datasource/). The source code is at https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton-grafana-source. You can run streaming SQL with the plugin and build live charts in Grafana, without having to refresh the dashboard. Check out [here](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton/tree/develop/examples/grafana) for sample setup.
