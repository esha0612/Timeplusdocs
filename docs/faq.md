# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I run Timeplus in our own cloud VPC or on-prem?

In the first few releases of Timeplus, our focus is the AWS-based fully-managed cloud service. Supporting other cloud vendors, or hybrid cloud is certainly doable. Please contact us with your requirements.

## How much data I can load into Timeplus?

For free accounts, the total storage for each workspace is 20GB by default. Please contact us if you need to load or keep more data.

## Can I invite other members to my workspace?

We are actively working on the team collaboration features and fine-grained access control. Please contact us via support@timeplus.com to try this experimental feature.

## What's the SLA and can I run production load?

We don't recommend the beta users to run production workload during the beta. Stay tuned for our official product releases.
